NETIQUETTE
Students are expected to behave professionally and respectfully at all times, in class, on campus, online,
and in course feedback surveys and student evaluations. That means there is to be no offensive
language, no threats, and absolutely no discussion/hints/threats of violence. Disrespectful language will
not be tolerated and will be reported to Campus Police if the instructor deems that such language may be
harmful to the psychological well-being of others or represents a need for assistance by the offending
student.
Students should be aware that their behavior impacts other people, even online. We hope that we will all
strive to develop a positive and supportive environment and will be courteous to fellow students and your
instructor. Due to the nature of the online environment, there are some things to remember when taking
an online course and engaging with others.

COURSE POLICIES
Late Assignments
To alleviate pressure and possible conflicts with other commitments, students may request at most 2
penalty-free extensions on WeBWorK homeworks per semester. Each extension will be of at most 3 days
and cannot go beyond the date of the exam for which the homework applies. For example, if Homework A
were due 9/20, the extension would be until 9/23 with no submissions allowed after that date. Late
Back to TOC Page 7 of 12 Last updated: August 15, 2025CSC 226 Course Syllabus (Fall 2025)
assignment requests must be submitted via the Google Form available on Moodle. Only extension
requests received within 24 hours of the original assignment deadline will be considered.
No late submissions will be allowed for labs.
Incomplete Grades
If an incomplete grade is authorized by the instructor, the instructor will prepare a contract that outlines
the assignments already completed, the assignments that need to be completed to resolve the
incomplete, and the deadlines/timeline for the completion of these assignments. The student must sign
and return the contract to the instructor no later than noon on the day course grades are due for the
semester. No additional extensions will be granted beyond the updated deadlines outlined on the contract
prepared by the instructor. An incomplete is potentially appropriate only when missing a few assignments,
not for missing half the semester or missing a significant number of assignments. An incomplete will be
considered only if the student is currently meeting minimum grade requirements.
The university policy on incomplete grades is located at http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3.
An unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next
regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12
months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an
attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the
student.
Attendance and Participation
Attendance is required and will be taken in class using Moodle. If you miss more than 15 minutes of class,
you will be considered absent. Attendance may be taken multiple times during a class period. If you do
not mark yourself as present during class, you will be marked absent. You are expected to participate in
class.
If you are unable to attend a class for any reason, there is no need to contact the instructor. You can
access course materials in Moodle. The only exception is for exam days. There are two in-class exams
and a final exam for this class.
Makeups for Exam 1 and Exam 2 will only be given for:
1. anticipated excused absences on exam days that are presented to the instructor no later than
one week before the absence as makeup exam will be scheduled prior to original exam date.
Examples include student is away from campus representing an official university function where
documentation from University faculty or staff member is presented to instructor, religious
observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs, and required military
duty as certified by the student’s commanding officer.
2. unanticipated excused absences that are verified by Absence Verification (e.g., deaths, legal
obligations, military duty, and serious illnesses like surgery and hospitalizations) within one week
of the exam period as makeup exams must be taken within a week of original exam date.
For students who miss Exam 1 and/or Exam 2 for any other reason (unexcused absences or
unanticipated excused absences not verified by Absence Verification), then the portion of the Final Exam
Back to TOC Page 8 of 12 Last updated: August 15, 2025CSC 226 Course Syllabus (Fall 2025)
that covers missed exam will count for the missed exam; for example, if a student misses Exam 1 and
scores 90 on the Exam 1 portion of the Final Exam, then their Exam 1 score would be 90.
For the Final Exam, all anticipated excused absences on assigned Final Exam days must be presented to
the instructor no later than one week before the absence. Exam makeups for anticipated excused
absences must be completed before the original exam time (before the absence instead of after returning
from the absence). For unanticipated Final Exam absences the student must provide written
documentation of an excused absence to the instructor before grades are due for the semester, then the
student’s course grade will be recorded as IN (incomplete), and the student will need to complete the final
exam within 1 week of returning from the absence. For unexcused absence during Final Exam period,
Final Exam grade will be recorded as a 0.
Final exam reschedule requests (due to other exam conflicts) must be approved by the university and
communicated with the instructor at least 1 week before the scheduled final exam start time. If you have a
conflict with your final exam schedule (e.g., three or more consecutively scheduled final examinations
within any 24-hour period), you can access the Exam Reschedule tool in MyPack by navigating through
the Planning & Enrollment tile.
For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see
https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03-attendance-regulations/.
Withdrawal Process: https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-classes/withdrawal/process/
Exam Policy
You will have the opportunity to improve your Exam 1 and Exam 2 grades during the Final Exam. The
final exam will be cumulative and cover materials from the whole semester. The Final Exam will have
three categories of question:
●
Category 1 questions cover materials from Exam 1 (Unit 1)
●
Category 2 questions cover materials from Exam 2 (Unit 2)
●
Category 3 questions cover materials covered between Exam 2 and the end of the semester (Unit
3)
If your score for Final Exam Category 1 questions is higher than your original Exam 1 grade, we will
replace your Exam 1 grade with your score from Category 1 questions. If your score for Final Exam
Category 2 questions is higher than your original Exam 2 grade, we will replace your Exam 2 grade with
your score from Category 2 questions.
Calculator Policy
Calculators are not permitted for CSC226 Exams.
UNIVERSITY POLICIES
Academic Integrity and Honesty
Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of
Student Conduct. In general, any action that attempts (successfully or not) to give you or another student
Back to TOC Page 9 of 12 Last updated: August 15, 2025CSC 226 Course Syllabus (Fall 2025)
an unfair advantage over other students when it comes to grading constitutes an academic integrity
violation. Therefore, students are required to uphold the university pledge of honor and exercise honesty
in completing any assignment.
Please refer to the Academic Integrity web page for a detailed explanation of the University’s policies on
academic integrity and some of the common understandings related to those policies.
To avoid conviction for academic integrity violations you must:
●
●
Avoid communicating with other students during an exam.
Avoid sharing details of homework solutions with any other person via public message board
posts, email, text, etc.
●
Cite all websites, papers, and books used as resources when creating homework solutions and
explain how these were used (e.g.,
"we used the Wikipedia article [insert link] on Boolean algebra
to help me understand basic Boolean operations"); the exception is material linked to from the
course Ed Discussion site.
●
Not use external web sites (such as Chegg and CourseHero) unless you clear it first with the
instructor; posting questions or accessing such sites to look for answers is a serious violation.
●
Not use AI tools or services, like ChatGPT, to generate partial or complete solutions to
assessments in the class. AI tools and services should not be used as a starting point that the
student will then edit. The use of these services are prohibited for assessed work in this class.
●
Write all homework solutions from scratch using your own words; paraphrases of solutions from
other sources are unacceptable even if you cite those sources.
If an academic integrity violation occurs, the offending student(s) will be assessed a penalty that
is no credit for the course, making the course ineligible for Grade Exclusion under University
Regulation 02.20.16 (resulting in an F as a final grade on the student's transcript). The case will
always be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. No exceptions.
While your deliverable is your work, the assignment artifacts and lecture materials are the intellectual
property of the instructors and the university. You may not post any assignment artifacts, assignment
solutions, or lectures to a publicly accessible website or public code repository during or after the
semester.
Sharing attendance codes with students who are not in class or submitting attendance codes when not in
class will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct with the above recommended sanction.
This course (lab assignments) may involve electronic sharing or posting of personally identifiable student
work or other information with persons not taking or administering the course. Students will be asked to
sign a consent form allowing disclosure of their personally identifiable work. No student is required to sign
the consent form as a condition of taking the course. If a student does not want to sign the consent form,
he or she has the right to ask the instructor for an alternative, private means of completing the
coursework.
Students are responsible for reviewing the NC State University PRR’s which pertains to their course rights

COURSE EVALUATIONS
ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The
current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended
questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to
these 15 common-core questions.
Each semester students’ responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class.
Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure
dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors’
personnel files and are considered confidential.
Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the
semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email
directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first
day of finals.
