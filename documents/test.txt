Soccer, known as football outside North America, is the world’s most popular sport and has a history that spans over two thousand years. Early forms of the game were played in ancient China, Greece, and Rome, where people kicked balls made of leather or animal bladders. The modern version of soccer, however, began to take shape in 19th-century England. In 1863, the Football Association (FA) was founded in London, establishing the first standardized rules of the game. This moment marked the split between soccer and rugby, which had previously been played under mixed rules. As industrialization spread, so did soccer, quickly becoming a favorite pastime among the working class. By the late 1800s, the game had reached Europe and South America through British sailors and traders. The first international match took place in 1872 between England and Scotland. In 1904, FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was founded in Paris to govern international competition. The inaugural FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930, with the host nation winning the title. Over the decades, soccer evolved into a global phenomenon with icons like Pelé, Diego Maradona, and Lionel Messi inspiring millions. The game has also been a powerful cultural force, uniting nations and breaking social barriers. Women’s soccer gained prominence in the late 20th century, with the first Women’s World Cup held in 1991. Today, billions of fans watch professional leagues like the English Premier League and La Liga. Soccer continues to grow in popularity, blending tradition with modern technology to shape its future.
